==> Solution Equation: 9.0*kenyan+8.0*sumatran=20.0*8.4 and kenyan+sumatran=20.0

*** A chemist has two acid solutions. One solution is 20 % pure acid and the other is 60 % pure acid. How much of 20 % pure acid and 60 % pure acid is needed to produce 80 square-centimeters of a solution that is 45 % pure acid?
What does a chemist has? --> two acid solutions
Is the other 60 % pure acid? --> 60 % pure acid
Is a solution 45 % pure acid? --> how much of 20 % pure acid and 60 % pure acid is needed to produce 80 square - centimeters
Is One solution 20 % pure acid? --> one solution is 20 % pure acid
How would you describe the other? --> 60 % pure acid
How would you describe a solution? --> 20 % pure acid and the other is 60 % pure acid . how much of 20 % pure acid and 60 % pure acid is needed to produce 80 square - centimeters
How would you describe One solution? --> 20 % pure acid
How many solution is 20 % pure acid? --> two
Does a chemist has two acid solutions? --> a chemist has two acid solutions . one solution is 20 % pure acid and the other is 60 % pure acid
How many acid solutions does a chemist has? --> two
For what purpose is How much of 20 % pure acid and 60 % pure acid needed? --> to produce 80 square - centimeters
==> Solution Equation: 0.20*twenty_acid+0.60*sixty_acid=0.45*80.0 and twenty_acid+sixty_acid=80.0

*** A cosmetologist has a bottle of 7 % hydrogen peroxide solution and a bottle of 4 % hydrogen peroxide solution. The cosmetologist needs 300 milliliters of a 5 % hydrogen peroxide solution. Find how many milliliters of each solution the cosmetologist needs to mix together.
What does a cosmetologist has? --> a bottle of 7 % hydrogen peroxide solution and a bottle of 4 % hydrogen peroxide solution
What does the cosmetologist mix? --> 7 % hydrogen peroxide solution and a bottle of 4 % hydrogen peroxide solution
What does The cosmetologist need? --> 300 milliliters of a 5 % hydrogen peroxide solution
What does the cosmetologist need? --> 300 milliliters of a 5 % hydrogen peroxide solution
Does the cosmetologist mix how many milliliters of each solution? --> find how many milliliters of each solution the cosmetologist needs to mix together
Does the cosmetologist need how many milliliters of each solution? --> 300
How does the cosmetologist mix how many milliliters of each solution? --> find how many milliliters of each solution the cosmetologist needs to mix together
Does The cosmetologist need 300 milliliters of a 5 % hydrogen peroxide solution? --> the cosmetologist needs 300 milliliters of a 5 % hydrogen peroxide solution
How many milliliters of a 5 % hydrogen peroxide solution does The cosmetologist need? --> 300
Does a cosmetologist has a bottle of 7 % hydrogen peroxide solution and a bottle of 4 % hydrogen peroxide solution? --> a cosmetologist has a bottle of 7 % hydrogen peroxide solution and a bottle of 4 % hydrogen peroxide solution .
==> Solution Equation: 0.07*seven_peroxide+0.04*four_peroxide=0.05*300.0 and seven_peroxide+four_peroxide=300.0
