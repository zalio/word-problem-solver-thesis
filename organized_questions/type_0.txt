*** The Kings won two less than three times as many games as they lost. They played 82 games. How many wins and losses did the team have? 
What did they play? --> 82
What do the team have? --> wins and losses
What did the Kings win? --> two less than three times as many games
Did they play 82 games? --> they played 82
How many games did they play? --> 82
Do the team have How many wins and losses? --> how many wins and losses
Did the Kings win two less than three times as many games as they lost? --> the kings won two less than three times as many games as they lost
How many less than three times as many games as they lost did the Kings win? --> two
How many two less than three times as many games as they lost did the Kings win? --> won two
==> Solution Equation: won+lost=82.0 and won=3.0*lost-2.0

*** The second number is 3 less than twice the first number. Their sum is 57. Find the second number.
Is their sum 57? --> their sum is 57
How would you describe their sum? --> 57
Indicate characteristics of the second number. --> find
Is the second number 3 less than twice the first number? --> the second number is 3 less than twice the first number
How many less than twice the first number is the second number? --> 3
==> Solution Equation: second_number=2.0*first_number-3.0 and first_number+second_number=57.0
~~~

*** 1 number is 9 less than twice another , and their sum is 42. Find the two numbers. 
Is their sum 42? --> * * * 1 number is 9 less than twice another , and their sum is 42
How would you describe 1 number? --> 9 less than twice another
How would you describe their sum? --> 42
How many numbers is 42. Find the? --> two
Is 1 number 9 less than twice another? --> 1 number is 9 less than twice another
How many number is 9 less than twice another? --> * * * 1
How many less than twice another is 1 number? --> 9
==> Solution Equation: first_number+second_number=42.0 and first_number=2.0*second_number-9.0
~~~

*** One number is 3 less than twice another. If their sum is 39 , find the numbers. 
Is their sum 39? --> if their sum is 39
How many is their sum? --> 39
When do the numbers find? --> if their sum is 39
How would you describe their sum? --> 39
How many do find If their sum is? --> 39
How would you describe one number? --> 3 less than twice another
Indicate characteristics of one number. --> if
Is one number 3 less than twice another? --> one number is 3 less than twice another
When is one number 3 less than twice another? --> if their sum is 39
How many number is 3 less than twice another? --> one
How many less than twice another is one number? --> 3
How many is If their sum is 3 less than twice another? --> 39
==> Solution Equation: larger+smaller=39.0 and larger=2.0*smaller-3.0

*** Class A and class B donated their class fund totaling 127 dollars to an orphanage. If the amount donated by class A is 7 dollars short of 0.6667 of the amount donated by class B. How much did Class A Donate? How much to class B donate?
Did by class A donate the amount? --> 7 dollars short of 0 . 6667
Did by class B. donate the amount? --> 0 . 6667
What did class A and class B donate? --> 127 dollars
Indicate characteristics of the amount donated by class A. --> 7 dollars short of 0 . 6667
Did class A and class B donate their class fund totaling 127 dollars? --> 7 dollars short of 0 . 6667
Where did class A and class B donate their class fund totaling 127 dollars? --> an orphanage
How many of the amount donated by class B. is the amount donated by class A? --> 0 . 6667
Is the amount donated by class A 7 dollars short of 0.6667 of the amount donated by class B? --> if the amount donated by class a is 7 dollars short of 0 . 6667
Where is the amount donated by class A class B the amount donated by 7 dollars short of 0.6667 of the amount donated by class class B? --> 127 dollars to an orphanage
How many of the amount donated by class B. How much did class A Donate ? How much to class B donate did donate If the amount donated by class A is 7 dollars short of their class fund totaling 127 dollars? --> 0 . 6667
==> Solution Equation: class_a+class_b=127.0 and class_a=0.6667*class_b-7.0
