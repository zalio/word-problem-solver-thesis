*** The sum of 2 integers is 30. 2 times the larger integer is 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer. Find the smaller number and larger number.
Is the sum of 2 integers 30? --> the sum of 2 integers is 30
How many is the sum of 2 integers? --> 30
How many integers is the sum of 30? --> 2
How would you describe the larger integer? --> 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer
How would you describe the sum of 2 integers? --> 30 . 2 times the larger integer is 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer
How many times is 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer 2 times? --> 30 . 2 times
When is the larger integer 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer? --> 30 . 2 times
Is the larger integer 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer 2 times? --> 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer
How many less than 5 times the smaller integer is the larger integer 2 times? --> 10
How many 10 less than 5 times the smaller integer is the larger integer 2 times? --> 30 . 2 times
==> Solution Equation: 2.0*larger=5.0*smaller-10.0 and smaller+larger=30.0

*** The sum of 2 numbers is 15. 3 times one of the numbers is 11 less than 5 times the other. What is the smaller number? What is the larger number?
Is the larger number What? --> 11 less than 5 times the other . what is the smaller number
Is the sum of 2 numbers 15? --> the sum of 2 numbers is 15
Is the smaller number What? --> what is the smaller number ? what is the larger number
How many is the sum of 2 numbers? --> 15
How many numbers is the sum of 15? --> 5
How would you describe the larger number? --> what
How would you describe one of the numbers? --> 11
How would you describe the smaller number? --> what is the smaller number ? what is the larger number
How would you describe the sum of 2 numbers? --> 15 . 3 times one of the numbers is 11 less than 5 times the other
How many times is 11 less than 5 times the other 3 times? --> 3
When is one of the numbers 11 less than 5 times the other? --> 15 . 3 times
Is one of the numbers 11 less than 5 times the other 3 times? --> one of the numbers is 11 less than 5 times the other
How many of the numbers is 11 less than 5 times the other 3 times? --> 3 times one
How many 11 less than 5 times the other is one of the numbers 3 times? --> 3
==> Solution Equation: 3.0*number_one=5.0*number_two-11.0 and number_one+number_two=15.0
~~~
