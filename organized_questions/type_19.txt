What did two airplanes leave? --> the same airport
When do it take how many hours? --> 1625 miles
Did two airplanes leave the same airport? --> two airplanes left the same airport traveling in opposite directions
Does the distance between them be 1625 miles? --> how many hours
How many airplanes did leave the same airport? --> two
How would you describe the distance between them? --> 1625 miles
What do it take for the distance between them be 1625 miles? --> how many hours
Do it take how many hours for the distance between them be 1625 miles? --> if one airplane averages 400 miles per hour and the other 250 miles per hour , how many hours
==> Solution Equation: 250.0*hours+400.0*hours=1625.0
